1. Your function should take in diceCount as a parameter.
2. It should then return the array it gets by calling
   getDiceRollArray(). Remember to use as an argument.
3. There's no need to set up a new variable - you can map
   over the array returned by getDiceRollArray directly to
   return the html template for each dice.
